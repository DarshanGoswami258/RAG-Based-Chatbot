AI-Powered PDF-Aware Chatbot – Darshan Goswami


This project involves the development of an intelligent chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to explore enhancements in user–bot interaction. The core objective is to enable the chatbot to comprehend the contents of a given PDF and engage in dynamic, context-aware conversations based on user queries.
Key technologies and modules include:
- LangChain for orchestrating the conversational flow
- Google Generative AI for generating intelligent, personalized responses
- PyPDF for document parsing and data extraction
- Streamlit for deploying a responsive and user-friendly web interface
- Custom Python functions for tailored logic and preprocessing
The chatbot is deployed via Streamlit, offering real-time interaction and personalized guidance. This project blends Python, prompt engineering, and modern AI frameworks to demonstrate how document-aware conversational agents can elevate user experience.
